A simulator of a rotor cipher machine, known as the Enigma machine, during World War II


ENIGMA MACHINE
The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. The theory behind the machine is that each letter typed should be shifted by a random number. This is accomplished by three rotors which rotate once per letter, when a rotor shifts it defines a new electrical pathway (i.e. a new shift amount). So as the message is typed the rotors move along to define new shifts each letter. However during World War II, a team called "Ultra", who were working for the Allies cracked the machine. This helped cut short the war.

HOW TO USE THE SO CALLED MACHINE AND SEND ENCRYPTED MESSAGES TO YOUR FRIENDS!
<br /> NOTE!! All the letters have to be input as uppercase!!

First you can switch the orders of the letters in the alphabet making it hard to decrypt. To do so press the space bar. So you can switch A with P and now the order will be: PBCDEFGHIJKLMNOAQRSTUVWXYZ. To continue to keep switching the order press the space bar when prompt.

Next is setting the three rotors. The rotors go from 3 to 1. Just enter a single letter for each rotor to set it.

Lastly is entering the message to encrypt it. NOTE!! The message should have no SPACES, that is because having spaces makes it easier to decrypt then just a string of letters. Also just like a typewriter there is no backspace a mistake is a mistake, so you need to restart the message again. However if it’s one letter then it should be easy to figure out when decrypted. Hit enter or the “.” key when done and the encrypted message should be underneath the original message. To write another message press the space key to restart the whole process.

NOW HOW DO WE DECRYPT A MESSAGE WE RECEIVED??
<br /> Simple! All you need to know is the information about how the message was encrypted.
That means you need to know what order of the letters were and what the three rotors were set to. Once all that data is inputted into machine, just type in the encrypted message and the result should be the original message.

LET’S DO A CONTROL TEST
<br />Set the order of the letters to: ABCDEZGHIJRLMNOPQKSTUVWXYF. So F & Z are switched as well as R & K
<br />Next set the rotor 3 to: T, Set rotor 2 to: C, And Rotor 1 to: A
<br />Now the message will be: THEALLIESAREPLANNINGSOMETHINGINJUNE
<br />The encrypted message will be: AJQTGUJMNBTHOWLGLZRJCFXPSSNRPADIDKL
<br />Now to decrypt the message back to its original. Again, set the order of the letters to: ABCDEZGHIJRLMNOPQKSTUVWXYF and keep the rotors the same: T,C,A. Now input the encrypted message and it will return back the original message.
